# NetRadar – Network Intrusion Detection & Traffic Analysis System

NetRadar is a lightweight network monitoring project developed to analyze live and captured network traffic in a controlled lab environment.

The system processes network packets to extract communication metadata such as source and destination addresses, ports, and protocol usage. This information is used to identify unusual patterns such as abnormal connection attempts, unexpected protocol behavior, or potential reconnaissance activities like port scanning.

NetRadar is intended to simulate how network-level telemetry can support investigation and triage workflows by generating alerts when suspicious traffic patterns are detected.

This project was created for educational purposes to gain practical insight into network traffic analysis and intrusion detection concepts.
